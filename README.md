# Document-Classification-Using-CNN

There are 18828 documents with 20 different types.

Each document needs to be classified based on its type.

In this project I have used CNN to classify the documents.

Each document consists of an email, subject and text .

These documents have been pre-processed before training the model on the data for classification of the documents.

Two models have been used for classification:

Model-1: 1-d CNN with word embeddings.

Model-2: 1-d CNN with char embeddings.
